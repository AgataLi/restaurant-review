#Restaurant Review 
It is a project made during my FEWD course in Udacity.


## Project Overview
In this project I was supported with code which had a lot of issues. I took a static design that lacks accessibility and converted the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also added a service worker.

### How to use it

1. Clone this repo

2. You need to use localserver. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000` or python -m http.server 3000

3. When the server is runnig, open the project in your browser: localhost:3000
